He is the co-Principal Investigator of the UM IDEA Lab whose mission is to implement, disseminate, educate, and advocate for the health of people who use drugs. His research has focused on the infectious complications of substance use, particularly among people who inject drugs, leveraging data-driven approaches to improve health services, systems, and policy implementation for this population. Dr. Bartholomew led the research and evaluation efforts of the IDEA Miami Syringe Services Program (SSP), the first legal syringe services program in Florida. His research and advocacy efforts translated into statewide legislation allowing all counties in Florida to implement these evidence-based programs in 2019.

His research has been funded by the National Institutes of Health, Center for Disease Control and Prevention and Gilead Sciences and has resulted in over 50 publications in high impact journals including American Journal of Public Health, Clinical Infectious Diseases, Addiction, and International Journal of Drug Policy. He is an investigator in the Clinical Trials Network Florida Node Alliance funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. He currently supports statewide implementation of SSPs in Florida through a partnership with the Florida Harm Reduction Collective where they leverage community-driven implementation science to improve adoption, implementation, and sustainment of programs. Dr. Bartholomew received his Ph.D. in Prevention Science from the University of Miami. He also sits on the board for the Florida Harm Reduction Collective.
